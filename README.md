### Let your api's be blessed by the stormfather, so you never have to fear outdated documentations anymore.

We all know api documentation is difficult. Stormblessed samples and analysis your backend traffic and generations automatic documentation for it. 
When new fields are added, you get a notification urging you to add descriptions to the new fields. When fields are removed, you get an alert, that your API contract might have been broken. 


This project is a work in progress.
